A cipher grille is a 4Ã—4 square of paper with four windows cut out.
Placing the grille on a paper sheet of the same size,
the encoder writes down the first four symbols of his password inside the windows (see fig. below).
After that, the encoder turns the grille 90 degrees clockwise.
The symbols written earlier become hidden under the grille and clean paper appears inside the windows.
The encoder then writes down the next four symbols of the password in the windows and turns the grille 90 degrees again.
Then, they write down the following four symbols and turns the grille once more.
Lastly, they write down the final four symbols of the password.
Without the same cipher grille, it is difficult to discern the password from the resulting square comprised of 16 symbols.

Write a module that enables the robots to easily recall their passwords through codes.
